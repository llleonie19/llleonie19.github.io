<p>  
    Measles is a virus that is a member of the morbillivirus family,<br/> (close to swine and rinderpest).<br/> 
    It doesn't mutate, its structure hasn't changed in decades.<br/> 
    This virus was discovered by a Persian doctor named Rhazès in the 10th century.<br/>
<br/>
Uncomplicated measles is characterized by four phases:<br/>
• a silent incubation period<br/>
• a period of invasion with various symptoms<br/>
• measles rash (appearance of red patches)<br/>
• a desquamation with a persistent state of fatigue<br/>
<br/>
But it can also have complications, in 10 to 40% of frail or malnourished people.<br/>
Most often it is complications in children under 5 years of age and adults over 20 years of age that cause death.

    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The epidemic
    </span></h3>

    <p>
        Measles is a virus that has a high rate of spread, according to doctor Olivier Robinea. <br/>
        a single patient can infect an average of 18 people,<br/>
        unvaccinated, or who have already been affected by this disease.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        To better understand how the virus spreads within a population, it is necessary to understand the following <br/>
        we've created a simulation that explains its behaviour. <Br/>
        -blue balls = people who aren't infected,<br/>
        -red  balls = people who are infected ,<br/>
        -gray balls = people who are recovered.<br/>
        A person becomes infected if he or she comes into contact with a sick person,<br/>
        unless she's immune or has already had measles.

<p>
    Here we compare weeks 12 in 2018 and in 2019 and we see :<br/>
that the number of measles cases per week is quite low for a country of about 70 million people, <br/>
that there were half as many cases of measles in 2019 as there were in 2018 at the same time,<br/>
that these are obviously just declarative data and not true biological diagnoses,<br/>
that, as a result, actual measles is probably less frequent than reported measles, <br/>
that measles immunization coverage has not changed significantly between 2018 and 2019.

    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One solution: the vaccine</span></h4>
<p class="p5">
    The measles vaccine was developed in the 1960s and was introduced to the market in 1975. <br/>
    It's called a live attenuated vaccine, which means that it's the live but purified virus that's injected into us.<br/>
    The European Action Plan sets out the following strategy adopted by the 53 Member States to eliminate measles.<br/>
    More importantly, at least 95% of the population must be immunized,<br/> 
    by administering two doses of vaccine or prior exposure to the virus, to ensure protection of the entire community<br/>
    including babies who are too young to be vaccinated, and those who cannot be vaccinated due to illness and health problems.
    But since 1980, on average only 90% of the population has been vaccinated, and even in some countries the rate of vaccination is as low as 70%.
</p>

<p>
    This animation represents a population of a rich country of which 90% are vaccinated.<br/>
    -blue balls = people who are vaccinated,<br/>
    -red  balls = people who are infected ,<br/>
    -gray balls = people who are recovered.<br/>

    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Permanently eliminate measles</span></h5>
<p class="p8">
    To prevent outbreaks and eliminate measles, 
    countries should maintain immunization coverage with two doses of measles vaccine.<br/>
    They must also identify and address all pockets of under-vaccination in their population.<br/>
    The Regional Office continues to work with Member States in the Region to improve their immunization and disease surveillance systems.<br/>
    This includes capacity building and advice for the following purposes:<br/>
</p>
<p class="p9">
    -ensure, that all population groups have, equitable access to immunization services;<br/>
    -identify people who haven't been vaccinated and give them the vaccines they need;<br/>
    -ensure that health workers are vaccinated, to prevent virus transmission in services;<br/>
    -strengthening confidence in measles vaccines is important and as health authorities;<br/>
    -ensure access to a rapid, but affordable supply of vaccines, for all people in Europe;<br/>
    -improve detection in the first instance, and then, the response to a sudden outbreak ;<br/>
    -listen to the populations affected by the epidemic and then respond to their concerns;<br/>
</p>
<p class="p10">
    Most of the countries in the Region where measles immunization coverage is sub-optimal are middle-income countries.<br/>
    The Regional Office is working with these countries to implement a coordinated strategy targeting several programmatic areas.
